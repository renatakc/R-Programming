1) Create a star network with 5 nodes
2) Convert the network to an adjacency matrix

3) Find the edge indices in the USairports network that have a distance > 1500
4) Use the edge indices to create the long haul (>1.500 miles) flights network
5) How many airports can you get to from Oakland(OAK) with a single top?


Degree is how many networks I have
Clustering is about measuring triangles/triples (transitivity)
